##HTML5: The Open Web Platform

### [[HTML]]
HTML (Hyper Text Markup Language), is the base layer of the web. HTML is a markup language that you use to mark up web pages un tags.

### [[CSS]]
CSS (Cascading Style Sheets) is the way that we style our markup.

### [[SVG]]
SVG (Scalable Vector Graphics) is a markup language like HTML, but instead of describing content in a document, it describes the points and curves of a vector.

### [[JavaScript]]
JavaScript is a programming language. We use JavaScript to write software in the web browser.

### [[Browser (Host) programming interfaces]]
The web browser programming interface is a set of programming interfaces the allow web developers to use JavaScript to interact with the user's operating system. This interface is often called the DOM (Document Object Model)- an object representation of a document loaded into a browser window. The 'document' object is a property of the 'window' object which is available to every developer in JavaScript. The 'window' object holds all of the sexy new HTML5 developer interfaces that you've been hearing about for building 3D offline event-driven ajax applications and web pages

### [[Browser Extensions]]
All of the desktop browser vendors provide extension interfaces for requesting access to things users have to say yes to through an installation process. For example, you can get access a users bookmarks, a screenshot taking interface, override default pages, and so forth.

### [[MathML]]
MathML (Math Markup Language), is a markup language for writing mathematical notations.

### [[HTTP]]
HTTP (Hypertext Transfer Protocol) is a RESTful protocol for transferring hypertext. This is the protocol that we use to do ajax, and so it is important to know it.

### [[Meta Data]]
We have several ways to to add meta data to our markup to make it more semantically meaningful, and machine readable.

### [[I18n]]
I18n (Internationalization (L - 18characters - N)), is a set of tools and addons to some of technologies above for making our software and webpages work cross browser.
