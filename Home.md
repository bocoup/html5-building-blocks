##HTML5: The Open Web Platform
HTML5 has become a brand to describe the Open Web Platformâ€“ a collection of technologies that fit together to make a platform for building network software. The specifications that define these technologies, like HTML, CSS and the DOM, are created by standards bodies for browser implementors, rather than web developers.

Because they are organized according to how a programmer should implement the technologies in a web browser, these specifications fall short of educating web developers how to consume them.

The goal of this documentation is to cover the technologies according to how a web developer would use them.

## Technologies

#### [[HTML|Hyper-Text-Markup-Language]]
HTML (Hyper Text Markup Language), is the base layer of the web. HTML is a markup language that you use to mark up web pages with tags.

#### [[CSS|Cascading-Style-Sheets]]
CSS (Cascading Style Sheets) is the way that we style our markup.

#### [[SVG|Scalable-Vector-Graphics]]
SVG (Scalable Vector Graphics) is a markup language like HTML, but instead of describing content in a document, it describes the points and curves of a vector.

### [[JavaScript]]
JavaScript is a programming language. We use JavaScript to write software in the web browser.

### [[Browser programming interfaces]]
The web browser programming interface is a set of programming interfaces the allow web developers to use JavaScript to interact with the user's operating system.

### [[Browser Extensions]]
All of the browsers provide provide their own proprietary extension interface for requesting access to secured parts of a users' computer. For example, you can get access a user's bookmarks, a screenshot taking interface, override default pages, and so forth.

#### [[MathML|Math-Markup-Language]]
MathML (Math Markup Language), is a markup language for writing mathematical notations.

#### [[HTTP|Hyper-Text-Transfer-Protocol]]
HTTP (Hypertext Transfer Protocol) is a RESTful protocol for transferring hypertext. This is the protocol that we use to do ajax, and so it is important to know it.

### [[Meta Data]]
We have several ways to to add meta data to our markup to make it more semantically meaningful, and machine readable.

### [[I18n]]
I18n (Internationalization (I - 18characters - N)), is a set of tools and addons to some of technologies above for making our software and webpages work cross browser.
