####Programming Interface
A programming interface is an interface for programmers to write code to interact with other code the same way that a user interface is an interface for a user to interact with other software. Often times the term API, or Application Programming Interface is used to refer to the JavaScript interfaces available in the browser. On HTML5 Building Blocks, we call these features programming interfaces.

####Window
The window is quite literally the browser window that a user has open. Each tab in a tabbed browsing session is it's own window. This is significant, because a window represents an encapsulated execution context. No code written in one window can touch any other window unless the second window is spawned from the first (like a popup or an iframe), or if you write a [[browser extension|Browser-Extensions]].

####DOM
The Document Object Model (DOM) is an object representation of a document loaded into a window.
