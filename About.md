HTML5 has become a brand to describe the Open Web Platformâ€“ a collection of technologies that fit together to make a platform for building network software. The specifications that define these technologies, like HTML, CSS and the DOM, are created by standards bodies for browser implementors, rather than web developers.

Because they are organized according to how a programmer should implement the technologies in a web browser, these specifications fall short of educating web developers how to consume them.

The goal of this documentation is to cover the technologies according to how a web developer would use them.
