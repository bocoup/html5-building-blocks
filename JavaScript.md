JavaScript is a programming language invented by the honerable Brendan Eich in 1995 when he worked at netscape. It is a programming language born of the internet, and developed for the browser. However, JavaScript is not just a browser scripting language. JavaScript is a first class programming language with desktop and server side runtimes just like any other programming language.

###Object
Objects are the building blocks of JavaScript programs. In JavaScript, everything is an object.

Here is an example of a JavaScript Object. This object is called an object literal, because it is literally written out in the code, as apposed to being constructed by a function and stored in memory:
    {
      property: 'value',
      secondPropery: {
        property: 'this is a property of the secondProperty object which is a property of the parent object literal'  
      }
    }

An object can also be assigned to a variable like so `var myObject = { property: 'value', secondProp: 'anotherValue'}`

    'I am a string of text'
