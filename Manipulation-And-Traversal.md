The browser provides a powerful programming interface for traversing and manipulating the document. This is often called DOM traversal and manipulation. DOM stands for Document Object Model. This object representation of the document after it is loaded into the window provides numerous methods for interacting with itself. You can interact with the DOM through `document` and `element` methods properties. Many of the DOM methods are polymorphic across `document` and `element` in that the same method name does different things depending on weather it is called on `document` or `element`.
