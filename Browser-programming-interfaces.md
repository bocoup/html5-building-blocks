##[[Manipulation & Traversal]]
The browser provides a powerful programming interface for traversing and manipulating the document. This is often called DOM traversal and manipulation. DOM stands for Document Object Model, and this object representation of the document after it is loaded into the window provides numerous methods for interacting with itself: 

##[[Event Interface]]
Bind to user events, and clean up after yourself: [[Add Event Listener]], [[Remove Event Listener]]

##[[Events]]
Use the [[event interface]] to bind to these different types of events: [[Mouse Events]], [[Keyboard Events]], [[Navigation Events]], [[Window Events]], [[Form Events]], [[Touch Events]], [[User Interface Events]], [[Mutation Events]], [[Media Events]]

##[[Media]]
Programmatically interact with audio, video and images: [[Audio interface]], [[Video interface]], [[Image interface]], [[Audio data and web audio interfaces]], [[Media Capture]]

##[[Graphics]]
Use these interfaces to create rich graphics: [[canvas interface]], [[WebGL]]

##[[Offline tools]]
Store data in local databases, cache resources in the web browser and let your users run your web apps and websites without an internet connection: [[Web Storage, [[Session Storage]], [[Local Storage]], [[IndexedDB]], [[Application Cache]], [[Notifications]]                        

##[[User Data access]]
Get access to the user's current location, read and write files on file system, access the users clipboard, and record load times: [[Geolocation]], [[File Interface]], [[Device Orientation]], [[Clipboard]], [[Navigation timing]]

##[[Client/Server]]
Load data into the page without reloading the page: [[XMLHttpRequest]], [[XHR2]], [[Web Sockets]], [[Server Sent Events and Event Source

##[[Cross Document communication]]
Send messages between multiple contexts (between a page and it's iframes, to popups and other children windows, to external threads): [[Post Message]], [[Web workers]]

##[[Misc]]
    * Push State Interface
    * Device API

##[[New Stuff Comming]]
    * [[Real time communication]]
    * [[Frame refresh rate]]
