Bellow are a list of programming interfaces available in the browser. These interfaces are often collectively called the DOM (Document Object Model)- an object representation of a document loaded into a browser window. The 'document' object is a property of the 'window' object which is available to every developer in JavaScript. The 'window' object holds all of the sexy new HTML5 developer interfaces that you've been hearing about for building 3D offline event-driven ajax applications and web pages

##[[Manipulation And Traversal]]
The browser provides a powerful programming interface for traversing and manipulating the document. This is often called DOM traversal and manipulation. DOM stands for Document Object Model. This object representation of the document after it is loaded into the window provides numerous methods for interacting with itself.

##[[Event Interface]]
Bind to user events, and clean up after yourself: [[Add Event Listener]], [[Remove Event Listener]]

##[[Events]]
Use the [[event interface]] to bind to these different types of events: [[Mouse Events]], [[Keyboard Events]], [[Window Events]], [[Form Events]], [[Navigation Events]], [[Touch Events]], [[User Interface Events]], [[Mutation Events]], [[Media Events]]

##[[Media]]
Programmatically interact with audio, video and images: [[Audio interface]], [[Video interface]], [[Image interface]], [[Audio Data API]], [[Web Audio Interface]], [[Media Capture]]

##[[Graphics]]
Use these interfaces to create rich graphics: [[canvas interface]], [[WebGL]], [[Request Animation Interface]]

##[[Offline tools]]
Store data in local databases, cache resources in the web browser and let your users run your web apps and websites without an internet connection: [[Session Storage]], [[Local Storage]], [[IndexedDB]], [[Application Cache]], [[Notifications]]                        

##[[User Data access]]
Get access to the user's current location, read and write files on file system, access the users clipboard, record page load times, get access to users' devices, and change the window location url without reloading the page: [[Geolocation Interface]], [[File Interface]], [[Device Orientation Interface]], [[Clipboard Interface]], [[Push State Interface]], [[Device Interface]]

##[[Client/Server]]
Load data into the page without reloading the page: [[XMLHttpRequest Interface]], [[XHR2 Interface]], [[Web Sockets Interface]], [[Event Source Interface]]

##[[Cross Document communication]]
Send messages between multiple contexts (between a page and it's iframes, to popups and other children windows, to external threads): [[Post Message Interface]], [[Web Workers Interface]]

##[[New Stuff Comming]]
These unimplemented interfaces are not yet standardized, but are really cool: [[Real time communication]], [[Frame refresh rate]], [[Tab visibility]], [[Fullscreen]]
